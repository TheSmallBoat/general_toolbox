A lightweight p2p network library implementation.

Brief description:
1. This is a fork of the github.com/perlin-network/noise project, and some code was refactored.
2. The purpose of the fork is to expand or integrate other technologies according to own ideas and habits in the future.

Notes:
* Package noise is an opinionated, easy-to-use P2P network stack for decentralized applications, and cryptographic protocols written in Go.
* Noise is made to be minimal, robust, developer-friendly, performance, secure, and cross-platform across multitudes of
devices by making use of a small amount of well-tested, production-grade dependencies.
* Please attention that the license information about the Perlin-Network noise includes in the documentation of naming "NOISE MIT LICENSE".
